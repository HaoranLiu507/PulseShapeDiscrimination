    A class representing a tempotron, as described in Gutig & Sompolinsky (2006).

    The (subthreshold) membrane voltage of the tempotron is a weighted sum from all incoming
    spikes and the resting potential of the neuron. The contribution of each spike decays
    exponentially with time, the speed of this decay is determined by two parameters tau and
    tau_s, denoting the decay time constants of membrane integration and synaptic currents,
    respectively.

    Note that we add some custom parameters to the model:
    - echo is used to control display output
    - dendrites_num is used to set the number of encoded neurons
    - A is used to control the range of Gaussian receiving field encoding

        This method is used for Gaussian encoding.

        The method takes two tensors Latency_spike_time and Latency_labels as parameters.

            Parameter initialization: Initialize some variables including beta, Imax, Imin, m, n, mu, j and sig among others.

            Build mu matrix: Compute two different time Imin and Imax's mu values that will be used to construct
            Gaussian distribution and used for encoding.

            Building Gaussian method for encoding: After initializing the user's weight vector,
            create Gaussian_spike_time, whose value will be a Gaussian distribution computed in the
            connection matrix (weight matrix).
            The vector will be three-dimensional (n, m, dendrites_num) and will be used to compute the total
            input of neurons. That is, Latency_spike_time and mu matrix are iteratively added to Gaussian_spike_time.

            Threshold processing: To produce a sparse neural activity pattern,
            the output y value is truncated and transformed to the (0,1) range.
            Two thresholds T_1 and T_2 are set to reduce quantization noise and remove noise.
            After this, binary matrix processing is performed based on the threshold,
            so that the output is generated only when the y value is higher than T_1 and lower than T_2.
            Negative information is removed from it.

            Elimination of uncoded information: Convert Latency_labels into a time window in the Latency_labels * (0,1)
            range that will be used to move time. Subtract the time window from the spike time Gaussian_spike_time.
            Gaussian_spike_time is set based on Gaussian distribution calculated from Gaussian_spike_time, mu and sig.
            After calculation, extra values are removed from the matrix to remove uncoded information.

            Replace the 0 values in Gaussian_spike_time with NaN.
