"""
Wavelet Transform (WT2) method with Marr wavelet for pulse shape discrimination.

This module implements a wavelet-based approach to pulse shape discrimination
using the Marr (Mexican Hat) wavelet transform. The discrimination factor is
computed as a ratio of signal integrals in different domains.
