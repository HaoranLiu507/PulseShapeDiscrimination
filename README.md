## Overview

The Pulse Shape Discrimination (PSD) project is a comprehensive Python/MATLAB toolbox for discriminating between different types of radiation particles based on their pulse shapes in scintillation detector signals. PSD is critical in radiation detection for nuclear security, medical physics, and scientific research.

## Project Description

This toolbox implements a broad collection of PSD algorithms spanning statistical time/frequency-domain methods, neural models, classic machine learning, and modern deep learning. Neutron vs. gamma discrimination is provided as a default demo. With your own datasets, other particle types can be used as well. For detailed discussions and benchmarking across methods, see our survey: [[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02750)].

### Key Features

- **Multiple methodologies**: Time-domain, frequency-domain, neural network (spiking), machine learning, and deep learning
- **Flexible pre-processing**: Built-in filters (Butterworth, Chebyshev, Elliptic, Fourier, LMS, Median, Morphological, Moving Average, Wavelet, Wiener, Windowed-Sinc)
- **Comprehensive evaluation**: Figure of Merit (FOM) computation via histogram fitting
- **Modular design**: Clean extension points for new algorithms
- **Two task types**: Classification (labels) and regression (PSD factor)
- **MATLAB support**: MATLAB implementations for time/frequency-domain and spiking neural methods

## Project Structure

## Dataset

The companion dataset, pre-trained models, and experimental results are hosted on Zenodo and are required to reproduce the figures and benchmarks in the survey paper.

- Download: [Zenodo DOI](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16728732)
- After download, extract or place the folders so they appear under `PulseShapeDiscrimination/Data/` (and optionally `Output/` if provided). The default Python scripts expect these files:
  - `Data/Train/EJ299_33_AmBe_9414_neutron_train.txt`
  - `Data/Train/EJ299_33_AmBe_9414_gamma_train.txt`
  - `Data/Test/EJ299_33_AmBe_9414_neutron_test.txt`
  - `Data/Test/EJ299_33_AmBe_9414_gamma_test.txt`
  - `Data/Validation/EJ299_33_AmBe_9414.txt`
  - `Data/Reference_signal/EJ299_33_AmBe_9414_neutron_ref.txt` (for GP/LLR)
  - `Data/Reference_signal/EJ299_33_AmBe_9414_gamma_ref.txt` (for GP/LLR)

Data format: each `.txt` file is a numeric matrix with shape `(num_signals, num_samples)`, one pulse waveform per row.

MATLAB note: the `.m` demos expect `EJ299_33_AmBe_9414.txt` to be on the MATLAB path or in the same folder as the `.m` file; adjust the `importdata` path in `MATLAB/*_main.m` if you keep data under `Data/`.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12 or higher
- MATLAB R2023a or higher (only for MATLAB implementations)
- Optional: CUDA toolkit for GPU-accelerated deep learning

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HaoranLiu507/PulseShapeDiscrimination.git
   cd PulseShapeDiscrimination
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install required packages:

   - Contents include: datasets (AmBe, PuBe), pre-computed results, and per-dataset PSD parameters.
   - Place the extracted `Data/` folder into the project root. Refer to Dataset section above.

   See the Zenodo `README.txt` for additional details.

### Notes on plotting backends

The FOM plotting utility selects Matplotlib's `TkAgg` backend in `Utility/histogram_fitting_compute_fom.py`. On headless systems or if Tk is not installed, do one of the following:
- edit `Utility/histogram_fitting_compute_fom.py` and change `matplotlib.use('TkAgg')` to `matplotlib.use('Agg')`; and/or
- call `histogram_fitting_compute_fom(..., show_plot=False)` so plots are saved to files instead of shown.

### Notes on Tempotron (GPU-only)

The Tempotron implementation requires a CUDA-capable NVIDIA GPU and a CUDA-enabled PyTorch build. CPU (and Apple `mps`) execution is not supported.

- Ensure `python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"` prints `True`.
- Install the correct CUDA wheel for your system (see PyTorch site), and make sure the NVIDIA driver is installed.
- The low-level class in `Utility/Tempotron.py` uses `cuda:0` by default. If you need to select another GPU, set `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` accordingly or adjust the file locally.

## Usage

The project provides separate main scripts for different PSD methodologies. All Python entry points are interactive and will prompt for filter choice, task (where applicable), method, and whether to train or load a model.

### Statistical Methods (Time Domain)
```bash
python Time_domain_main.py
```

### Statistical Methods (Frequency Domain)
```bash
python Frequency_domain_main.py
```

### Statistical Methods (Neural Network)
```bash
python Neural_network_main.py
```

### Machine Learning Methods
```bash
python Machine_learning_main.py
```

### Deep Learning Methods
```bash
python Deep_learning_main.py
```

### MATLAB
Open MATLAB, navigate to the `MATLAB/` directory, and run a main script. For example:
```matlab
run('Time_domain_main.m');
```
Repeat similarly for `Frequency_domain_main.m` and `Neural_network_main.m`.

### Quickstart (Python, example)

The following transcript shows a typical deep learning classification run:

1) Run: `python Deep_learning_main.py`
2) When prompted for filter: enter `0` (no filter) for a first run
3) Task: enter `c` for classification
4) Method: enter `MLP1` (or try `CNNDEEP`, `GRU`, etc.)
5) Train? enter `y` to train a new model
6) Validation? optional; enter `n` to skip on first run

Results and any saved outputs will appear under `Output/` (method-dependent). For regression tasks, you will additionally be asked to select a feature extractor used to compute target PSD factors.

### Command-line (non-interactive) usage

All main scripts now accept CLI flags. If a required flag is missing, the script will prompt interactively for that item only.

- Deep learning (`Deep_learning_main.py`)
  - Flags: `--task {classification,regression}`, `--method <MLP1|MLP2|MLP3|CNNDEEP|CNNFT|CNNSHAL|CNNSP|CNNSTFT|CNNWT|ENN|GRU|LSTM|RNN|TRAN|MAM>`, `--feat <CC|GP|...>` (when task=regression), `--filter {0..11}`, `--train {yes,no}`, `--validate {yes,no}`
  - Example (classification, train, no validation):
    ```bash
    python Deep_learning_main.py --task classification --method MLP1 --filter 0 --train yes --validate no
    ```
  - Example (regression with CC features, train and validate):
    ```bash
    python Deep_learning_main.py --task regression --feat CC --method CNNDEEP --filter 1 --train yes --validate yes
    ```

- Machine learning (`Machine_learning_main.py`)
  - Flags: `--task {classification,regression}`, `--method <BDT|DT|FCM|GMM|KNN|LINRE|LOGRE|LRSTFT|LVQ|SVM|TEM>`, `--feat <...>` (when task=regression), `--filter {0..11}`, `--train {yes,no}`, `--validate {yes,no}`
  - Example:
    ```bash
    python Machine_learning_main.py --task classification --method SVM --filter 0 --train yes --validate no
    ```

- Time-domain statistical (`Time_domain_main.py`)
  - Flags: `--method <CC|CI|FEPS|GP|LLR|LMT|PCA|PGA|PR|ZC>`, `--filter {0..11}`
  - Example:
    ```bash
    python Time_domain_main.py --method PR --filter 0
    ```

- Frequency-domain statistical (`Frequency_domain_main.py`)
  - Flags: `--method <FGA|SDCC|DFT|WT1|WT2|FS|SD>`, `--filter {0..11}`
  - Example:
    ```bash
    python Frequency_domain_main.py --method SD --filter 9
    ```

- Spiking neural models (`Neural_network_main.py`)
  - Flags: `--method <HQC|LG|PCNN|RCNN|SCM>`, `--filter {0..11}`, `--validate {yes,no}`
  - Example:
    ```bash
    python Neural_network_main.py --method SCM --filter 0 --validate yes
    ```

Notes:
- When any CLI flag is provided, interactive plotting is disabled and Figures of Merit will be saved to files instead of displayed.
- You can always run `python <main>.py --help` to see the available flags.

Filter IDs (0–11):
- 0: No Filter
- 1: Butterworth
- 2: Chebyshev (Type I)
- 3: Elliptic
- 4: Fourier (low‑pass in frequency domain)
- 5: Least Mean Square (LMS) adaptive
- 6: Median
- 7: Morphological (open/close)
- 8: Moving Average
- 9: Wavelet (db4)
- 10: Wiener
- 11: Windowed‑Sinc (FIR)

Sampling frequency note: for demonstration purposes the main scripts set `fs = 1000` Hz to parameterize filters. If your signals were sampled at a different rate, adjust `fs` (and filter parameters) near the top of each `*_main.py`.

### General Workflow

1. **Choose entry point**: one of the main scripts per method family
2. **Filtering**: optional signal denoising/filter selection
3. **Task**: choose classification or regression (ML/DL only)
4. **Method**: choose a PSD algorithm from the prompts
5. **Train or load**: ML/DL scripts support training or loading
6. **Evaluate**: automatic test-set evaluation; optional validation-set evaluation
7. **Analyze results**: view metrics, figures, and any saved outputs

**Notes:**
- MATLAB implementations are provided for statistical methods; ML/DL methods are Python-only.
- Python implementations are generally more feature-complete (filters, visualization).
- Default dataset is AmBe. To switch datasets, update the file paths near the top of each `*_main.py`.
- Some methods require additional data: GP and LLR need reference signals under `Data/Reference_signal/`, and SD builds a discrimination mask from training data.

### Non-interactive usage

Use the CLI flags described above to run in non-interactive mode. Missing flags will be prompted.

## Extending the toolbox

Adding a new method is straightforward:

- Statistical methods (time/frequency/spiking): implement `get_psd_factor(data: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray` in a new module under the appropriate `Method/Statistical_methods/...` subfolder and import it in the corresponding main script mapping.
- ML/DL methods: implement the following functions in `Method/Prior_knowledge_methods/...` modules so they can be discovered from the main scripts:
  - `get_supported_tasks() -> list[str]` returning `['classification']`, `['regression']`, or both
  - `train(data: np.ndarray, labels: np.ndarray, task: str, feat_name: Optional[str]) -> None`
  - `load_model(task: str, feat_name: Optional[str]) -> None`
  - `test(data: np.ndarray, task: str, feat_name: Optional[str]) -> np.ndarray`

Please also document method references and default hyperparameters in module-level docstrings.

## Contributing

Although this project incorporates most PSD algorithms developed over the last five decades, there are still methods that have not been included, as well as newly emerged approaches. Contributions to this project are welcome! Here's how you can contribute:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature-name`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature-name`
5. Submit a pull request

### Guidelines
- Follow the existing code style and organization
- Add concise docstrings where needed (focus on why, not how)
- Include basic sanity checks or tests where practical
- Update the README if necessary

## Troubleshooting

- **Matplotlib/Tk errors on headless systems**: set `MPLBACKEND=Agg` or edit calls to `histogram_fitting_compute_fom(..., show_plot=False)` to save plots instead of showing them.
- **Shape errors**: Ensure `.txt` files are 2D arrays with one pulse per row.
- **NaN warnings**: Some methods may produce NaNs for certain signals/parameters. The scripts remove NaNs and continue; consider adjusting method hyperparameters.
- **Unsupervised clustering label flips (ML)**: The ML entry point automatically flips labels when needed via majority voting.
- **Tempotron fails to run / device errors**: Tempotron requires CUDA-enabled PyTorch and an NVIDIA GPU. Verify `torch.cuda.is_available()` is True, install the correct CUDA wheel, update your GPU drivers, and (optionally) set `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to choose a GPU.
