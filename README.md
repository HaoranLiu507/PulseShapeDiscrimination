## Overview

The Pulse Shape Discrimination (PSD) project is a comprehensive Python/MATLAB toolbox for discriminating between different types of radiation particles based on their pulse shapes in scintillation detector signals. PSD is a critical technique in radiation detection that enables the separation of different particle types based on the characteristic shapes of their pulse signals, which is essential for applications in nuclear security, medical physics, and scientific research.

## Project Description

Pulse shape discrimination is essential in radiation detection systems to distinguish between different types of radiation. This project employs a variety of approaches to PSD, incorporating both statistical methods and prior knowledge models. Neutron and gamma-ray discrimination serve as the default application demo for this project. By incorporating additional datasets, other particle types can also be utilized. For a more detailed description of the PSD methods incorporated in this project, as well as comparisons and analyses between these methods, please refer to our review article: [[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02750)].

### Key Features:

- **Multiple PSD Methodologies**: Implements time-domain, frequency-domain, neural network, machine learning, and deep learning approaches
- **Flexible Pre-processing**: Various signal filtering options including Butterworth, Chebyshev, Elliptic, and Wavelet filters
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Tools for computing the Figure of Merit (FOM) to quantitatively evaluate discrimination performance
- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend with new algorithms and methods
- **Two Task Types**: Supports both classification (particle class identification) and regression (PSD factor prediction)
- **MATLAB Support**: Includes MATLAB implementations for time-domain, frequency-domain, and neural network methods

   ```

   The development versions used were:
   - torch==2.6.0
   - torchvision==0.21.0

5. Download the Companion Dataset from Zenodo

   The complete dataset, pre-trained models, and experimental results are hosted on Zenodo. This companion package is required to reproduce the figures and benchmarks presented in our survey paper.

   - **Download link**: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.16728732.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16728732)

   The Zenodo repository contains:
   - Datasets: Raw waveform data for both AmBe and PuBe sources.
   - Experimental Results: Pre-computed models, validation metrics, and summary spreadsheets.
   - PSD Parameters for PuBe Dataset: Python scripts with algorithm parameters tuned for the PuBe dataset.

   Please see the `README.txt` file in the Zenodo bundle for detailed instructions on using this data with the toolbox.

## Usage

The project provides separate main scripts for different PSD methodologies:

### Statistical Methods (Time Domain)
```bash
python Time_domain_main.py
```

### Statistical Methods (Frequency Domain)
```bash
python Frequency_domain_main.py
```

### Statistical Methods (Neural Network)
```bash
python Neural_network_main.py
```

### Machine Learning Methods
```bash
python Machine_learning_main.py
```

### Deep Learning Methods
```bash
python Deep_learning_main.py
```

### MATLAB
To run the MATLAB implementations, open MATLAB, navigate to the MATLAB/ directory, and execute one of the main scripts. For example:
```matlab
run('Time_domain_main.m');
```
Repeat similarly for Frequency_domain_main.m and Neural_network_main.m.

### General Workflow

1. **Choose Method**: Select the appropriate main script based on the method you want to use
2. **Apply Filtering** *(Python only)*: Select a filter to apply to the signals (or no filter)
3. **Select Task Type** *(ML/DL only)*: Choose between classification or regression task
4. **Choose Algorithm**: Select a specific PSD method from the available options
5. **Model Selection** *(ML/DL only)*: Choose to train a new model or load a pre-trained one
6. **Model Training** *(ML/DL only)*: Train and test the selected model
7. **Validation**: Evaluate on validation data
8. **Results Analysis**: View and analyze results in the Output directory *(Python only - MATLAB implementations do not save output as files)*

**Notes:**
* MATLAB implementations are provided for statistical methods, as many researchers in the PSD field are more familiar with MATLAB. However, machine learning and deep learning methods are only available in Python due to better library support.
* We recommend using the Python implementations for all methods due to their more mature functionality (filters, visualization, etc.). If you only intend to use Python, you can disregard the MATLAB directory.
* This repository uses a dataset detected from an AmBe neutron source by default. If you want to use other datasets, please change the path of data loading at the head of the main function of each PSD method category. For example, see lines 43-47 of 'Deep_learning_main.py'.
* **Important:** There are a few PSD methods (including GP, LLR, and SD) that require reference signals loaded from separate .txt files. If you changed the dataset, please make sure you update the reference signal from your new dataset. The reference loading procedure can be found in the PSD method .py file. For example, see lines 173-174 of 'Method\Statistical_methods\Frequency_domain\sd.py'.
